								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39864" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/omicron-in-children.jpg" alt="omicron in children" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p>It was just after the new year in 2022 when Mr. Jitin (name changed) started worrying about his 8-year-old son. He had developed a high-grade fever all of a sudden, with a temperature of 103°F. For obvious concerns, Mr. Jitin got him tested for COVID RT-PCR but his report was negative.</p>
<p>“There was a decline in temperature with paracetamol and sponging, but in one episode fever even spiked to 104°F with chills. We were really perplexed,” said Mr. Jitin. It was only on the 3rd day after getting the fever that his son was confirmed COVID positive on repeat RT PCR testing.</p>
<p>Many such cases have been reported by parents across different cities. Experts say, “Children under 5 years of age have narrower airways [1], which makes it easier for germs to sit where the omicron variant grows. This viral replication causes inflammation in the body. High fever is a response to this inflammation.” At large, symptoms of Omicron in children are similar to that of adults including sore throat, tiredness, body ache, and fever [2].</p>
<p><strong>Here are 5 things which every parent must know about Omicron in children:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Must-know #1 RT-PCR can be negative in the early days of illness</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Your child may have classic COVID symptoms like fever, cough, [3] however, the gold-standard RT-PCR test report could be negative.</p>
<p>&#8211; One possible explanation is that the testing happened too early. Though RT-PCR test is extremely sensitive, a certain threshold of viral particles must be reached before the test can catch it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What can you do about it?</strong></em></p>
<p>The optimal timing for RT-PCR tests is 2-4 days after the onset of symptoms, although many kids can test positive sooner than this.</p>
<p>If your child has COVID-like symptoms in the current situation of the third wave, consider it as COVID and take all precautions accordingly. Make sure to connect to a doctor and get guidance.</p>
<p><strong>2. Must-know #2 Stick to the basics: Comfortable clothing, sponging, and hydration</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Dressing:</strong> It is a natural reflex to cover the child with multiple blankets and warm clothings as chills or shivering comes. Do not overdress or put extra blankets on. Let the clothes be comfortable. Excess clothing tends to trap body heat and cause the temperature to rise.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Sponging:</strong> Use tepid water (neither hot nor cold to the touch) for sponging from head to toe for 15 mins after giving the fever medication. DO NOT use ice-cold water. To get the most out of it, keep the water film moving over the body (and don’t hold too much at one body area) for maximum temperature regulation.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Hydration:</strong> Optimum fluid intake is very important. As a natural response to fever, the body attempts to lower the temperature naturally through extensive sweating. If your kid doesn&#8217;t take enough fluids to replenish, he/she is likely to get dehydrated. Give lukewarm water as small, multiple sips. It helps bring down the core temperature and prevents dehydration too.</p>
<p><strong>3. Must-know #3: Paracetamol and Ibuprofen are medicines used in children for bringing the fever down.</strong></p>
<p>Paracetamol is the safest anti-fever medicine for children. The dose can be repeated after 4–6 hours. [4] Sometimes a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen is given to have a rapid response. <strong>Do not use aspirin or nimesulide for fever relief in children. <span style="font-weight: 400;">(These are two commonly used medicines for minor pain and fevers in adults.)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>If paracetamol appears unable to bring down the fever, remember these:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; If the initial fever was high, say 104°F, administration of paracetamol may bring it down to 101°F and not make the child afebrile. <strong>If you see a downward trend in temperature, consider it is working.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Remember, the purpose of fever medicine is not to bring down the temperature to normal level but to provide symptomatic relief to the child by reducing pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>&#8211; Avoid overdosing if the fever does not normalize. You can repeat the next dose after 4–6 hours if required.</p>
<p>&#8211; Paracetamol may start showing effect within 15-30 mins. The maximum effect comes after nearly 1.5 hours. [5]</p>
<p>&#8211; Paracetamol dosing depends on your child’s weight (and not age) and strength of medicine. Adequate dose of paracetamol for kids is 10-15 mg/kg. Different strengths of paracetamol syrups are available to cater to diverse pediatric needs. This helps reduce the amount/volume of syrup to be given and could be helpful.</p>
<p>&#8211; Other medicines (ibuprofen, mefenamic acid) are also available and should be used only in consultation with your pediatrician.</p>
<p>&#8211; Do not panic. Meanwhile, use tepid sponging. Adjust clothing if it is too tight or dressed up.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Don’t check temperature too often</strong></p>
<p>Usually, you can measure 3-4 times in a day, at a gap of four to six hours. However, if the first temperature is very high, you might decide to recheck the temperature on a more regular schedule, maybe once or twice an hour.</p>
<p><strong>4. Must-know #4: Anti-allergic medicines as prescribed by your doctor should be regularly given.</strong></p>
<p>Anti-allergic medicines including cetirizine, levocetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine, etc., have well-documented effectiveness in children. They help in relieving congestion, runny nose, and mucus buildup. Remember, do not treat your kids on your own or with your medicines. Follow dosage as advised by your child specialist.</p>
<p><strong>5. Must-know #5: Know the warning signs: When a fever may need hospitalization</strong></p>
<p>Visit the child specialist if your child is younger than 3 years of age or have any of the following:</p>
<p>&#8211; Extreme lethargy, drowsiness, excessive cry or irritation<br />
&#8211; Headache, neck stiffness, or breathing difficulty<br />
&#8211; Abnormal body movements or behavior<br />
&#8211; Temperature above 104°F<br />
&#8211; Fever persisting for more than 5 days</p>
<p>Similarly, in a child with fever, the following signs should make you relaxed:</p>
<p>&#8211; Playful and active during interfebrile period<br />
&#8211; Acts like himself/herself during most of the day<br />
&#8211; Feeding well<br />
&#8211; Passing urine normally</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Seizures during fever in babies don&#8217;t cause brain damage.</p>
<p>Sometimes, fever can trigger seizures in kids, most commonly in the age group of 6 months to 5 years. These are called febrile seizures, and they can run in the family. They can be just seconds long and usually last less than one minute. Febrile seizures do not result in brain damage or epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>The final word</strong><br />
While more data is being gathered around omicron in children, it is crucial to keep your child’s guards up with COVID-appropriate behavior and stay informed.</p>

<p>Starting your day with a glass of milk to make it healthier has always been the morning routine from childhood to adulthood. While milk is undoubtedly a great nutritional beverage, thanks to its vitamins and mineral profile, you can get the most of it by just simply switching to Camel milk. Wondering why? Well, in addition to all the nutrients present in milk, Camel milk is loaded with Vitamin C. Moreover, it has amazing therapeutic properties, which bring it closest to human milk[1]. Known as ‘white gold’ of the desert, let’s dig into Camel milk and its health benefits.</p>
<p><strong>5 Reasons To Switch To Camel Milk Today!</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Powerhouse of Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>Camel milk provides you a bucket full of nutrition because it is loaded with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins such as <strong>vitamin A, B, C, D, and E</strong>[1]. It also contains low levels of fat and sugar and is also a great source of minerals such as sodium, potassium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium. All these important nutrients not only help fulfill your daily nutritional needs but also improve your overall health. Moreover, it is believed to aid in growth and promote height in children when combined with a daily exercise routine and proper diet.</p>
<p><strong>Camel milk’s rich inheritance of nutrients makes it an ideal health drink for both children and adults. <a href="https://www.1mg.com/otc/hye-foods-camel-milk-powder-otc638621">Click here to grab your pack today</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Alternative for Lactose Intolerants</strong></p>
<p>If you are lactose intolerant (people who are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk), then drinking bovine milk can be a real problem. Camel milk <strong>contains less lactose</strong> than cow&#8217;s milk, making it more tolerable for many people with lactose intolerance[2].</p>
<p><strong>3. Strengthens the Immune System</strong></p>
<p>Our immune system produces antibodies to fight infection-causing microbes and one such simple, yet effective immune booster is Camel milk. It contains a series of protective proteins such as immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A, which help build a stronger immune system[3]. It also contains around <strong>3 times more Vitamin C than cow milk</strong>[4], which helps you to stay strong and fight infections.</p>
<p><strong>A weak immune system may make you prone to frequent health-related problems. Strengthen up your immune guards with Camel milk. <a href="https://www.1mg.com/otc/hye-foods-camel-milk-powder-otc638621">Click here to buy</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Packed with Protein</strong></p>
<p>The role of protein in the growth and development of the body is a no brainer. Proteins help boost metabolism, reduce appetite, build muscle mass, and repair cells. In addition to being responsible for building muscle mass and managing weight, they aid in recovery from illness and can reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease[3].</p>
<p><strong>5. Good for Diabetics</strong></p>
<p>Camel milk contains <strong>insulin-like protein</strong> which may have anti-diabetic properties[5]. It is also rich in zinc, an important mineral, which can help in the management of blood glucose levels and its associated complications.</p>
<p>Camel milk is loaded with benefits for young and adults likewise. It is true that Camel milk may not be as readily available in stores as the other forms of milk, but given its amazing health benefits, including it in your diet and reaping its benefits is not a bad idea. It’s never too late to try, <a href="https://www.1mg.com/otc/hye-foods-camel-milk-powder-otc638621">click here</a> to enjoy a cup full of Camel milk today!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39849" title="Complete Blood Count (CBC): Know Your Blood Test" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Complete-blood-test.jpg" alt="complete blood count" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complete blood count (CBC) is a simple yet crucial blood test which acts as your body’s disease detector. It is one of the most commonly recommended tests that scans through your blood components like red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets to reveal any health issues that your body might be harboring silently. The CBC test also serves as an important inclusion in your routine health check ups. Here’s more on what you must know about the CBC test, its various parameters, who should get tested and when to worry.</span></p>
<p><b>Who Should Get A CBC Test?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can get a complete blood count test done at any time. However, a CBC is usually recommended:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; As a routine preventive health check-up, especially in old age</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; In women of reproductive age, especially during and after pregnancy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; For people taking medicines for chronic diseases or chemotherapy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; In case of symptoms of allergy, viral or bacterial infections</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; In people with symptoms of constant fatigue, tiredness, weight loss, and reduced appetite</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; To monitor disease progression (like in dengue), side effects or response to treatment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; For screening before a surgery or procedure</span></p>
<p><b>CBC: How &amp; When Is The Sample Collected?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As CBC is a blood test, you need to give a blood sample. For accurate results, your sample is collected in an EDTA tube which maintains the blood in a fluid state and ensures the cells are preserved for analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The test can be taken at any time of the day. However, if you have high triglyceride levels, then you may be required to fast before giving the sample. </span></p>
<p><b>Want to check your triglyceride levels before getting your CBC done? </b><a href="https://www.1mg.com/labs/test/triglycerides-1958"><b>Click here to book your test now!</b></a></p>
<p><b>Understanding CBC Test Details &amp; Ranges</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are many parameters tested in a complete blood count, there are a few vital parameters (types) that are mostly looked at to check for an infection or disease. These 7 broad components are:</span></p>
<p><b>1. Red blood cells (RBC) &amp; hemoglobin</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your RBCs</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">contain a pigment called hemoglobin which gives the RBCs their characteristic red color. It is responsible for carrying oxygen to various parts of the body. A decrease in hemoglobin or RBC count is called anemia whereas an increase in the RBC count is called polycythemia. </span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; Low RBC count  or hemoglobin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> level can be due to nutritional deficiency, thalassemia, blood loss or chronic diseases (like kidney failure).</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; High RBC count or hemoglobin level</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be due to  smoking, decreased oxygenation(lung diseases), high altitude, genetic mutations or performance enhancing drugs.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s more on the</b><a href="https://www.1mg.com/articles/importance-of-hemoglobin-test-all-you-need-to-know/"><b> importance of hemoglobin</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Note: </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">High RBC count can be falsely shown in case of low water content due to dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, intensive exercise, and diuretics (high BP medicines). Pregnant women can show variation in hemoglobin level due to water retention. </span></i></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">2. Red blood cell indices</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This part of the CBC test helps detect anemia and its type. It tells you the amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hemoglobin present in RBCs and the size of your RBCs. Ideally, your red blood cells are about 7 microns in size.</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; H</b><b>ematocrit or packed cell volume (PCV):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Measures the percentage of RBCs present in your blood. A low hematocrit value indicates anemia which occurs when the number of RBCs or their size decreases.</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures the mean size of the RBCs. These are usually calculated in the analyzer from the red blood cell count and hematocrit values. Low MCV is usually a sign of iron deficiency whereas high MCV means Vitamin B12 deficiency.</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; Red cell distribution width (RDW): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">RDW is useful to understand the variation in sizes and shapes of RBCs. This helps diagnose anemia and identify the best way to treat it.</span></p>
<p><b>The values of the CBC test can be best interpreted by an expert. Instead of pondering upon your reports yourself, reach out to an expert. </b><a href="https://www.1mg.com/online-doctor-consultation"><b>Click here to consult</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">3. White blood cells (WBC)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells. They are responsible for maintaining the immunity in the body.</span></p>
<p><b>Low WBC count or leukopenia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may indicate infections, autoimmune disorders, large spleen, or bone marrow diseases. It may also occur due to medications for chronic diseases or cancer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>High WBC count or leukocytosis </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">may indicate infections, inflammation, or blood cancer (leukemia).</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">4. Differential count</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This shows the number of different types of white blood cells. It is expressed in percentage and absolute count. However, absolute counts are usually considered for diagnosis and monitoring treatment response of infections.</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; Neutrophils:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increased in bacterial infections</span></p>
<p><b>&#8211; Lymphocytes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Increased in viral infections</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-39828 size-full" title="Latest Updates on The Effectiveness of COVID Treatments, Antiviral Therapy, and Vaccines Against COVID Variants" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1686707104.jpg" alt="COVID variants" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019, there have been many variants of concern (VOCs) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus — special mention to the delta COVID variant, which has kept the world on edge. Now, in late 2021, a new variant named Omicron (VOC declared by WHO on November 26, 2021) is knocking on the door. There’s a lot unexplored about the possible upcoming COVID-19 wave, but there is one thing we are pretty sure about: Many will be sick if precautions are not taken!</em></strong></p>
<p>To prepare for the imminent threats of this virus, scientists and researchers are constantly working to develop new treatment strategies. During the second wave of the pandemic, several drugs and therapies, including favipiravir, steroids, ivermectin, and plasma therapy, were used to help improve the symptoms of COVID-positive people. But, with more research and studies, it was seen that not all of these therapies were useful.</p>
<p><strong>Recent advancements show that the newest yet most promising treatment options include monoclonal antibody therapy, antiviral agents, and vaccines.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s quickly review the latest treatment options available to battle these COVID variants and variants of concern!</p>
<p><strong>A. Monoclonal antibodies</strong><br />
During the second wave, researchers worldwide recognized the benefits of a new class of drugs, the monoclonal antibodies. This group of medicines showed promising benefits against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p>When encountered with an infection, the body naturally produces antibodies against the infection-causing pathogen, which help fight the infections.</p>
<p>Using this approach and extensive research, scientists developed monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the disease-causing pathogens by targeting the specific proteins present on their surface. Just like the body&#8217;s naturally produced antibodies do!</p>
<p>Summarized below are some of the latest and most promising monoclonal antibodies and their effectiveness against variants of concern such as Delta and Omicron:</p>
<p><strong>1. Casirivimab-imdevimab (Ronapreve):</strong> Cipla’s antibody cocktail therapy helps treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (aged 12 years or more weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk of severe COVID-19. Patients aged 65 years or older with certain chronic medical conditions can also receive this medicine [1].</p>
<p>On <strong>November 21, 2020</strong>, FDA gave emergency use authorization (EUA) to this medicine. India’s Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) approved this medicine for emergency use on <strong>May 3, 2021, making it the first monoclonal antibody to be approved in India</strong>.</p>
<p>This antibody cocktail therapy is effective against the Delta, a variant of concern first discovered in India.</p>
<p><em><strong>Data on the effectiveness of this drug against the Omicron variant is yet to be published, but few initial studies have suggested that the virus can escape its impact</strong></em> [4].</p>
<p><strong>2. Bamlanivimab-etesevimab:</strong> This monoclonal antibody drug combination from Eli Lilly is the first and only monoclonal antibody therapy approved for emergency use and post-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) in COVID-19 patients under 12 years of age.</p>
<p>It helps treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in people of any age group who are at high risk of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death [5].</p>
<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, this combination received emergency use authorization from the FDA, and in <strong>June 2021</strong>, the drug got emergency use approval in India [6].</p>
<p>This antibody cocktail retains neutralization activity against the Delta variant, the predominant variant of concern [7].</p>
<p><em><strong>So far, this combination has demonstrated reduced efficacy against the Omicron variant, but further results in a large population are still awaited</strong></em> [8].</p>
<p><strong>3. Regdanvimab, CT-P59:</strong> This medicine is given to COVID-positive people who do not need supplemental oxygen and are at increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19 [9].</p>
<p>Though approved by the European regulatory agencies, its approval in India is still pending.</p>
<p>This drug was found less effective against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta [10].</p>
<p><em><strong>Moreover, no conclusive evidence regarding its efficacy against omicron is available.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>4. Sotrovimab:</strong> This drug helps treat acute COVID-19 infection in symptomatic adults and adolescents (aged 12 years or above and weighing at least 40 kg). It is given to people who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID infection.</p>
<p>As per recommendation, sotrovimab should be administered within 5 days of COVID-19 symptoms onset.</p>
<p>Clinical trials for this drug are ongoing in India though regulatory authorities have already approved it in the UK on <strong>December 2, 2021</strong> [11].</p>
<p>Due to its unique mechanism of action, it has shown the potential to be effective against multiple variants of concern. Sotrovimab retains activity against all currently tested variants of concern, including, but not limited to, Delta [11].</p>
<p><em><strong>Based on the sequence of the Omicron variant, sotrovimab is likely to maintain activity and potency against this variant</strong></em> [11]. However, its efficacy is being studied for more accurate details.</p>
<p><strong>5. ZRC-3308:</strong> This drug cocktail by Zydus Cadila combines two monoclonal antibodies. In India, clinical trials for this drug are underway.</p>
<p><em><strong>Current variants of concern can be resistant to treatments focused on the spike protein expressed on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to the mutations in this region</strong></em> [12].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Antiviral agents</strong><br />
It is a class of medications that helps treat viral infections like COVID-19.</p>
<p>Based on initial research, several antiviral medicines like remedesivir and favipiravir were prescribed for COVID-19 during the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But since the virus is constantly changing its genetic makeup, older medicines may not prove that effective. Hence, newer drugs with broader impact and better efficacy are required to counter these recent changes.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of some antivirals that have been identified to help treat COVID-19 better and faster.</p>
<p><strong>1. Molnupiravir (Lagevrio):</strong> This antiviral medicine from Merck aids in treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><b>December 28, 2021,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved molnupiravir for the treatment of adult patients with COVID-19 with oxygen levels of more than 93% and who have a high risk of severe COVID disease requiring hospitalization or death [13]. </span>It is also the first oral antiviral approved by the UK regulatory agency [14].</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest phase 3 trials data,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> molnupiravir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was found effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults [14]. Studies have shown that the duration of treatment with molnupiravir is much shorter compared to other therapies which is a significant advantage as it allows you to take only one pill for COVID illness instead of many. As a result, most patients are able to complete their course of treatment [13].</span></p>
<p><strong>However, it is worth mentioning that the clinical trial was conducted before the Omicron variant was detected, and researchers are yet to understand its impact against the new SAR-CoV-2 mutation </strong>[14].</p>
<p><strong>2. Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir (Paxlovid):</strong> Pfizer’s Paxlovid is the first oral ‘take-home’ treatment of COVID-19 that received emergency approval in the US [15]. However, the drug is not approved in India yet.</p>
<p>It is used to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease in adults and pediatric patients (aged 12 years or more, weighing at least 40 kg) who are at risk of severe COVID-19. Treatment should start as soon as COVID-19 is confirmed and within 5 days of the symptom onset [16].</p>
<p><strong><em>It may act as a new tool against the fast-spreading new variant named Omicron</em></strong> [15].</p>
<p><strong>3. 2-DG (2-deoxy-D-glucose):</strong> Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this anti-COVID medication for the acute treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. This medicine is to be given as an adjunct to the existing standard of care treatment to hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>2-DG is the first Indian-origin anti-COVID medicine to receive emergency use approval by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in India on <strong>May 8, 2021</strong> [17].</p>
<p>This medicine stops the virus-infected cells from utilizing the glucose present in the body. As a result, the virus-infected cells die, and the virus fails to replicate. This helps prevent the infection, expediting recovery and reducing dependence on supplemental oxygen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C. Vaccines</strong><br />
India started vaccinating its population against COVID-19 in January 2021 with Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN. Since then, several other vaccines have received authorization from DCGI.</p>
<p>Till December 24, 2021, over 140 crore people have received at least 1 dose of the vaccine, and 68.65% of the Indian population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 [18].</p>
<p><em><strong>On December 25, 2021, PM Narendra Modi announced vaccination for children between 15 to 18 years of age</strong></em> [19].</p>
<p>A vaccine contains a weakened or dead form of a pathogen or a part of it. Upon vaccination, your immune system starts producing antibodies against the pathogen without causing illness. Your body now recognizes the pathogen and can fight it off in the future. Vaccines for COVID-19 also work on the same principle.</p>
<p><strong>Booster shots:</strong> “Booster” basically refers to an extra dose of a vaccine after the original (or primary) dose is administered. While the initial doses help develop a robust immunity against the pathogen by producing antibodies, booster shots help maintain the immunity levels. It is usually given when the immunity gained through previous doses starts to wane.</p>
<p>Due to the emergence of heavily mutated new SARS-CoV-2 variants (like omicron), on <strong>December 25, 2021</strong>, PM Narendra Modi announced <em><strong>COVID-19 precautionary doses for the frontline healthcare workers and people aged 60 years or more having comorbidities</strong></em> [19].</p>
<p><strong>1. COVAXIN (Bharat Biotech)</strong><br />
Approved in <strong>January 2021</strong>, it is a 2-dose vaccine given 28 days apart [20]. It is the <strong>first Indian vaccine</strong> to get approval for children 2-18 years of age [21].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot (intranasal):</strong> DCGI has approved a phase 3 clinical trial for the intranasal vaccine for COVID-19 to be used as a booster shot [22]. The intranasal vaccine will be administered to those who have already taken both doses of COVAXIN. It is suitable for both children and adults.</p>
<p><strong>The intranasal shots reportedly possess the potential to avert infection with the new variants of SARS-Cov-2, including Omicron.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Covishield (Serum Institute of India)</strong><br />
This vaccine got emergency use approval in India on <strong>January 6, 2021</strong>. It is approved to be used in individuals 18 years of age and older. It is a 2-dose vaccine regimen given 84 days apart [23].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot:</strong> Scientists are trying to evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine against the omicron variant of COVID-19 by growing the virus under laboratory conditions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Johnson and Johnson’s Janssen Vaccine</strong><br />
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized this single-dose vaccine for emergency use to prevent COVID-19 in individuals aged 18 years and older [24]. On <strong>August 7, 2021</strong>, CDSCO granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to this vaccine in India [25].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot:</strong> A European Medicines Agency (EMA) committee issued a positive opinion for using the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine as a booster for adults aged 18 and older.</p>
<p>It is supposed [26] to be given:</p>
<p>&#8211; At least two months after primary vaccination with a single shot of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and<br />
&#8211; As a ‘mix and match’ booster following primary vaccination with an approved two-shot mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen (known as heterologous boosting).</p>
<p>Booster clinical trials are ongoing to look for neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. Additionally, the manufacturers pursue an Omicron-specific variant vaccine and progress it as needed [27].</p>
<p><strong>4. Moderna</strong><br />
This vaccine has been granted conditional emergency approval in India to be used in adults 18 years or older to prevent COVID-19 [28].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot:</strong> Moderna hopes to start clinical trials early next year on a vaccine to protect against the fast-spreading Omicron variant but for now is focussing on a booster dose of its current vaccine [29].</p>
<p><strong>5. Sputnik</strong><br />
This Russia-produced vaccine that will be produced by Dr. Reddy in India is available as [30]<br />
&#8211; two-dose vaccine <strong>(Sputnik-V)</strong><br />
&#8211; a single-dose <strong>(Sputnik-Light)</strong> vaccine for adults<br />
&#8211; <strong>(Sputnik-M)</strong> for adolescents between 12 to 17 years</p>
<p><strong>Sputnik-V</strong> was the first foreign vaccine approved in India on <strong>May 14, 2021</strong> [30]. <strong>Sputnik-Light</strong> is available in India and is expected to get a DCGI nod as a standalone vaccine and a universal booster. Approval for <strong>Sputnik-M</strong> is underway in India [30].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot:</strong> On <strong>December 17, 2021</strong>, the manufacturer claimed that a booster shot of the Sputnik vaccine provides a more robust antibody response against the Omicron variant of COVID-19 [31].</p>
<p><strong>6. Zydus Cadila&#8217;s ZyCoV-D</strong><br />
In India, this vaccine got emergency use approval on <strong>July 1, 2021</strong>. It is safe for adults and children aged 12 to 18 years. It is a needle-free, three-dose vaccine given on day zero, day 28th, and day 56th [32].</p>
<p><strong>Booster shot:</strong> This vaccine is based on new technology (plug-and-play), allowing easy tweaking to protect against the mutated virus strains. Hence, the manufacturer is currently closely monitoring the global data on omicron and may easily tweak the vaccine if the situation demands it [33].</p>
<p><strong>On December 28, 2021, two more vaccines got authorized by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for COVID-19:</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>COVOVAX:</strong> Serum Institute of India and Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization. It is India’s first protein-based vaccine. This vaccine will be given in two doses and will help induce immunity against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and above [34].</p>
<p><strong>8. CORBEVAX:</strong> Biological E’s Corbevax which is India’s first indigenously developed protein sub-unit vaccine. This kind of vaccine contains a part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus&#8217;s surface called the spike protein. Essentially, the spike protein is that part of the virus which allows it to penetrate your body&#8217;s cells [35].</p>
<p><em><strong>Corbevax was found to be more than 80% effective against symptomatic infections caused due to the Delta variant</strong></em> [35].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Take home:</strong><br />
Undoubtedly much research on coronaviruses has been conducted, and various treatment strategies have been developed. However, with the changing pattern of this virus, these treatment strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccines, and antiviral treatments, may too see frequent updates to fight against the latest emerging variants of coronaviruses. As individuals, our immediate focus should be to arrest the spread of COVID-19 infection by adopting appropriate infection control measures like wearing masks, washing hands frequently, getting vaccinated, and avoiding crowded spaces.</p>

<p>Not many like the idea of an injection, but most people with diabetes need to do it every day. While the fear of injections may diminish over a period of time, there are some factors which can make the process more comfortable and less painful, while making insulin therapy effective. The length of the needle is one such factor.</p>
<p><strong>Proper depth for the injection</strong></p>
<p>It is important to remember that the injection must be delivered subcutaneously[1] i.e. in the fat tissue. The needle should be long enough to penetrate the skin and inject into the fat tissue, but not so long that it enters the muscle tissue. Insulin injected into muscle tissue is absorbed faster, leading to the risk of low blood sugar or hypoglycemia[1].</p>

<p><strong>Easy injection technique</strong></p>
<p>BD’s smallest and thinnest needle is the 4mm, 32-gauge needle. This is the recommended pen needle length for insulin injections at home for both adults and children using insulin pens.* There is little risk of injecting into muscle tissue with such a needle as compared to longer needles. The injection can be delivered “straight” without a skin fold, with the pen held at a 90 degree angle to the skin[2].</p>
<p><strong>*Children between 2 to 6 years and lean patients require to take a skin fold even with 4mm.</strong></p>

<p>Surgical instruments are no longer sterile after a single use and same is the case with insulin pen needles and syringes. Also, if you use the same needle repeatedly, it may not be able to do its job effectively. Hence, it is recommended to use it only once and dispose of safely, thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Risks of Re-Use</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Sterile Needle and Safety</strong></p>
<p>The needle is a product of precision engineering meant to administer insulin which is a life-saving medication for people with diabetes. It is designed to do its job well, only once. There is a risk of needles not being sterile after single-use[1] and can lead to infections.</p>
<p>Another incorrect practice is to share needles amongst individuals. In addition to the possibility of damaging the needle, the needle reuse puts patients in danger of contracting blood borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV[5].</p>

<p><strong>2. Tissue Damage and Bleeding</strong></p>
<p>Incorrect or multiple usage can cause damage to the needle and lead to blunting of the needle [2]. Distorted and bent needle results in more painful injection during reuse[2]. Blunt points can also cause tissue damage and bleeding. Also, reuse increases the risk of developing lumps and bumps at injection sites which can be a hurdle in the journey of good diabetes management[1,3,4].</p>
<p><strong>3. Risk of Lipohypertrophy</strong></p>
<p>The most common outcome of using the same needle multiple times is the formation of a lump under the skin[3,4]. Injecting into lumps and bumps can lead to erratic absorption of insulin causing hypoglycemia or fluctuations in blood sugar levels.</p>

Having a positive and encouraging mindset and regular monitoring of glucose levels can also go a long way in managing this condition with positive results.</p>

<p><strong>What are the key benefits of Activ Health Plan’s Chronic Management Program?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Day 1 Cover </strong><br />
Get covered from the start date of the policy if you are suffering from any of the above-mentioned chronic conditions at the inception of the policy. However, hospitalization related to these conditions will be covered after a waiting period of 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>&#8211; Health &amp; wellness coaches</strong><br />
These coaches can personalize workouts and nutrition plans specifically for you. They also review your medical reports and guide you accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>2. Choosing the Right Fitness Routine</strong></p>
<p>For diabetics, exercising is an important way to lower blood sugar levels but it can also be tricky. Exercising too hard or doing it wrong can harm your body. Here’s how you can exercise to shed excess fat and improve your sensitivity to insulin while following certain precautions.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes Workouts-at-Home</strong></p>
<p>Cardio exercises help to improve your heart health and lower your blood sugar levels. You can try these exercises that are generally beneficial for diabetics:</p>
<p><strong>Power Yoga:</strong> This is a more intense form of yoga. It has more cardiovascular benefits compared to the traditional Hatha Yoga technique.</p>
<p><strong>Cardio Pilates:</strong> Functional Pilates or Cardio Pilates strengthens your core, offers cardiovascular benefits, and improves your posture.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolism Conditioning:</strong> This workout includes cardiovascular exercises which improves your metabolism and increases the uptake of sugar in your blood.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Precautions for Diabetics</strong></p>
<p>If you are planning to start a diabetes exercise routine, you should ideally track your heart rate and blood sugar level during and after your workout. Here are some important precautions to follow before you build your own workout:</p>
<p>&#8211; Consult with your doctor to understand which exercises you can try safely.</p>
<p>&#8211; Build your strength and stamina by starting slow and increasing the intensity with time.</p>
<p>&#8211; Stay motivated for your daily exercise routine. Try and include more fun activities in your workouts.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you feel a sudden pain, listen to your body and stop immediately.</p>
<p>&#8211; Fruits or fruit juices are healthy carbs that you can consider consuming after a workout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/healthinsurance/campaign/cmp?source=Diabetes_1MGemailer&amp;utm_source=1MG&amp;utm_medium=Emailer&amp;utm_campaign=Diabetes21"><strong>In addition to diet and exercise, getting a health insurance can also help you with a healthy life. </strong></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Choosing to Focus on Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>Stress is known to be a major barrier in managing diabetes as it directly affects your glucose levels. Long-term problems with blood glucose can lead to constant stress that negatively affects your mental and physical health, making diabetes management difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Practices to Improve Mental Well-Being</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to manage diabetes effectively with better lifestyle choices. Although diabetes comes with its own set of lifestyle challenges, you can still lead a happy and healthy life.</p>
<p>&#8211; Start by adding short meditative sessions or small workouts to your daily routine.</p>
<p>&#8211; Look for diabetic support groups, find one that best suits your lifestyle and personality. Being proactive about your health can help ease the tension in your life.</p>
<p><strong>4. Choosing to Follow a Healthy Diet Plan</strong></p>
<p>While there is no single cure for diabetes, taking certain precautions can help keep your diabetes in check. You can start by eating right. Measuring your portion size and calorie intake is the best way to start managing blood sugar levels in diabetics. Here’s how you can create a balanced diet to effectively manage diabetes:</p>
<p><strong>Cut down fried foods</strong> or anything that contains high carbs, sweets, red meat, butter, salt, and sugary drinks from your diet. Instead, you should include more green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale, fresh fruits, and whole grains to your diet. They are good for the heart and eyes as well. Eat a small meal at 2 to 3 hour intervals to keep your blood sugar level steady.</p>
<p><strong>Check back on carbs.</strong> Carbohydrates are important as they are the main source of energy in your body. Instead of getting devoid of carbohydrates, focus on healthy carbohydrates and fiber-rich foods such as legumes (beans and peas) and low-fat dairy products. Diabetics may eat brown rice, whole grain bread, and whole-wheat pasta since they are starchy foods with a low glycemic index.</p>
<p><strong>Include healthy fats.</strong> Foods like fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, making them ideal for preventing heart diseases (commonly associated with diabetes). Healthy fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats may be a part of your meals in the form of avocado, nuts, olive oil, and groundnut oil.</p>
<p><strong>Snack wisely.</strong> Chia seeds and flax seeds are also important for diabetics as it can lower blood pressure and manage glycemic levels. This in turn decreases the risk of heart diseases.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, you should consult a dietician to create a proper diet plan that specifically suits your need. Work your way around a proper diet to control your diabetes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with diabetes often remain perplexed over their meal planning which includes cutting down on almost everything from their diet. But what most people are not aware of is the fact that with simple changes in the portions and the frequency of meals, your favorite foods and your routine diet can still remain intact. Here’s how!</span></p>
<p><b>Know Your Food</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our daily meal comprises various nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats and vitamins and minerals. Having a balanced proportion of each of these nutrients is important as each of them has a function to play in maintaining our overall health. So before you start planning your diabetic meal, here are few basic things to keep in mind:</span></p>
<p><b>Count the carbohydrates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that carbohydrates turn into glucose in your body and affect your blood glucose level more than other foods do. Choosing carbs can be intimidating as we can’t see how much of it is present in our meals. So, what best we can do is choose carbs that are nutrient-dense rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. For example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Ditch your regular atta with custom-made multi-grain atta (mix of ragi, chana dal, bajra, jowar and oats)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Replace white rice with brown or red rice, if you are a rice eater</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Opt for a good fibre rich food as a snack </span></p>
<p><b>Say YES to proteins</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proteins help increase insulin response without increasing the glucose levels in the blood. This is why, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people with diabetes should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensure that a minimum of 15-20% of their daily calories are coming from proteins which are high in fibre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Add legumes in every meal as they are rich in proteins and fibre</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Drink a glass of milk daily to get a fair amount of protein</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Consume raw or boiled vegetables (add a little seasoning for taste) more to up your protein intake</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out </span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/diabetes/diabetic-diet-584?filter=true&amp;brand=Nestle"><b>Nestle Resource Diabetic Powder</b></a><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a low GI diet for those with diabetes. It has high quality protein, fiber and essential vitamins and minerals that help amp up your diabetes meal planning.</span></p>
<p><b>Don’t leave vitamins &amp; minerals behind!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In diabetic patients, glucose metabolism is generally not up to the mark as there is an excess production of free radicals in the body. These free radicals can cause a deficiency of vitamins such as A, C, and E, raising the risk of health complications. To counter it,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Add natural food sources rich in Vitamin A and C to your diet like apples, oranges, strawberries, melons, etc</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Include minerals like zinc and magnesium that can help regulate glucose level</span></p>
<p><b>Don’t free the fats</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fats may seem like a big villain to everyone including diabetics, but that is not completely right. We should not devoid ourselves of fats as these are needed for energy, vitamin absorption and numerous other functions in the body. However, maintaining the balance and opting the right type of fats is the key. You can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Try to grill, steam, or bake foods instead of fried foods</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Use a blend of different types of oils for cooking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Opt for unsalted dry fruits and nuts for munching</span></p>
<p><b>4 Simple Handpicked Smart Choices For Diabetics</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to eating a healthy, balanced diet, here are some simple diet tricks to ensure a complete diabetic meal planning regimen.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Control salt intake:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Too much salt can affect blood pressure and cause stroke, which are already some known complications of diabetes. Get creative and try to limit salt by using different types of herbs and spices. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Time your food:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Knowing what to eat is good but having a knowledge of carefully timing when to eat may act as a game-changer in diabetes management. Generally, people with diabetes are suggested to have three meals a day at regular times. This helps utilize the insulin that your body produces or gets through a medication. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Be smart with snacking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how well you plan your meal each day if you end up snacking or binging on processed foods, all the efforts will come out fruitless. Choose better options like yogurt, salads, and nuts. </span></p>
<p><b>Love eating, but diabetes making your ingredients list short? Get your daily dose of health with </b><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/diabetes/diabetic-diet-584?filter=true&amp;brand=Nestle"><b>Nestle Resource Diabetic Powder</b></a><b>!</b></p>
<p><b>4. Move more often: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nly constant in diabetes management is to Keep Moving. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week. You can break it down into bite-size chunks of 10 minutes throughout the week or 30 minutes 5 times a week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A diabetes diet plan is nothing but a carefully chosen eating strategy designed to grab most of the benefits from the food we eat. It’s not rocket science guys! Just plan more carefully and don’t fall prey to fancy packaged foods. Choose wisely to stay healthy. </span></p>

<p>Antibiotic awareness week (12th-18th November), an initiative by WHO, aims to increase global awareness about the threat of antibiotic resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic use.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria acquire the ability to defeat the medicines designed to kill them. This means the bacteria are not destroyed and continue to thrive in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I care about antibiotic resistance?</strong></p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent threats to public health. Today, antibiotic resistance causes 7,00,000 deaths annually. This number is expected to rise by 10 million deaths annually by 2050.<br />
Once easily treatable infections with common antibiotics are becoming unmanageable. This is because antibiotic-resistant bacteria are often more difficult to diagnose, kill and more expensive to treat. In some cases, the antibiotic-resistant infections can lead to serious disability or even death.<br />
Misuse and overuse of antibiotics are the main reasons why bacteria develop resistance and render antibiotics ineffective. Without effective antibiotics many common infections and routine surgeries may become life-threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Why are bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics?</strong></p>
<p>Some bacteria normally acquire resistance to common antibiotics as a part of natural selection process. Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria (those which can be killed by antibiotics) are destroyed, but resistant bacteria are left to grow and multiply. This is how repeated and excessive use of antibiotics can increase the number of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Can I help protect myself and my community from antibiotic resistance?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can. Saving antibiotics is a collective responsibility. Please adhere to the simple steps below:<br />
&#8211; Don’t start or stop antibiotics by choice. Always follow the physician’s advice.<br />
&#8211; Avoid antibiotics for cold and flu. These infections are usually caused by viruses, not bacteria.<br />
&#8211; Don’t use leftover antibiotics or share them with others<br />
&#8211; Avoid using multiple antibiotic combinations. More is not always good.<br />
&#8211; Prevent infections by regularly washing hands and keeping cleanliness</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Let’s take a pledge during this antibiotic awareness week to ensure proper use of antibiotics!</strong></span></p>

<p>Are you someone who believes that exercise is worth it, only if it’s running or gyming? Well, we have news for you! Walking benefits your health too. Research shows that brisk walking for at least 30 minutes can help you burn 200 calories.[1]</p>
<p>However, there’s a catch to it. How many calories you burn by walking depends on how fast you’re walking. But, as per experts, even a normal-paced walk can have significant benefits. All this shows that walking is an exercise in itself. In this article, we unfold a few of the magnificent ways in which walking benefits your health.</p>
<p><strong>But First, Here’s How To Hack Your Walk</strong></p>
<p>Walking at a normal pace is beneficial too. But since the intensity of your walk usually determines its impact, here’s how to calculate your intensity:</p>
<p>&#8211; If you’re walking 80 steps per minute, it’s a low-intensity, leisurely walk. This is less impactful but definitely better than inactivity.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you’re walking 100 steps per minute, it’s a moderate intensity, medium-paced brisk walk. This is moderately impactful.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you’re walking 120 steps per minute, it’s a high-intensity, fast-paced brisk walk. This is most impactful and can help you burn a good amount of calories.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1mg.com/online-doctor-consultation"><strong>Talk to a doctor before deciding your pace of walk to prevent any strain.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>5 Ways In Which Walking Benefits Your Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Stronger Immunity:</strong> 30 minutes of daily brisk walking enhances blood flow and allows white blood cells (type of immune cells) to wander freely in your body. It also brings down your stress and has anti-inflammatory benefits. All these three mechanisms- improved blood flow, lowered stress and inflammation help your immune system work better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/coronavirus-prevention/boost-your-immunity-452"><strong>Your immune system is vast. Help this network stay nourished by supplying it with nutrients with our immunity boosters.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Fitter heart:</strong> Your heart pumps 1.5 gallons of blood every minute. All it needs to stay healthy is a bit of exercise and no stress. Roughly, a 21-minute walk daily can slash down your risk of heart disease by 30%.[2] This easy, no-cost exercise makes your heart fitter by regulating your heart rate and blood flow while pulling down your cholesterol levels and blood pressure.</p>

<p><strong>3. Better joints:</strong> Walking relieves arthritis pain by lubricating your joints and exporting oxygen and nutrients to them. You may even be able to protect your joints from arthritis if you walk for 8-9 km in a week.[3]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/health-conditions/bone-joint-muscle-care-34"><strong>Help your joints, bones and muscles to move better and stay pain-free with us.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Happy mood and sound sleep:</strong> Walking is the easiest form of exercise that can help reduce your risk of depression, anxiety, and memory decline. It also helps you sleep better by increasing happy hormones and decreasing stress hormones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/ayurveda/supplements/ashwagandha-76"><strong>Ashwagandha can have a soothing effect on your mind and may even help you sleep better.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Longer life:</strong> Walking reduces and even prevents the risk of severe chronic illnesses like diabetes, high BP, stroke, etc. It increases your breathing rate and helps your lungs flush out the toxins. It helps your body heal by speeding up the flow of nutrients through the blood. Walking may even help lower the risk of certain cancers such as colon cancer and breast cancer.</p>
<p>If walking at a fast pace seems like a challenge to you, start walking slowly. Stay consistent and try speeding up your pace with every passing day. Happy walking!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39729" title="Dengue Fever: When And How To Get Tested?" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Dengue-tests.jpg" alt="Dengue-tests" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p>D<span style="font-weight: 400;">engue is a mosquito-borne viral infection which can cause a severe flu-like illness. The infection spreads through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus). There are 4 Dengue virus strains (DEN 1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) commonly associated with dengue infection. Among these, DEN 2 is more commonly associated with outbreaks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As there has been a sudden rise in the cases of Dengue infection these days, here is a quick guide to know the symptoms and to prevent transmission of the virus. This guide will also help to identify what and when to get tested if you suspect dengue-like symptoms. </span></p>
<p><b>Signs &amp; Symptoms Of Dengue</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The symptoms of dengue usually appear 4-10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms associated with dengue fever may include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Fever as high as 104℉ or 40℃</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Severe headache</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Eye pain, typically behind the eyes (Retro-orbital pain)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Muscle, bone, or joint pain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Rash</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Nausea and vomiting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Loose motions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Decreased appetite</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Weakness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Swollen glands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fever can last for 5-7 days, but it may lose intensity around the 3rd to 7th day of illness. If the symptoms still persist with marked fatigue and generalized weakness, this could be an indication of the beginning of the critical phase (rapid decrease in the platelet count).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to know that in some cases people may not develop any symptoms or illness even after getting the virus. Still, it is advisable to consult a doctor or carefully analyze the symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these symptoms are similar to COVID, and other flu-like illnesses. It’s best not to ignore any symptoms.</span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/online-doctor-consultation"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get in touch with an expert immediately.</span></a></p>
<p><b>How To Diagnose Dengue?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blood test is generally advised if a person is down with fever, muscle pain, and weakness or has any other </span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/articles/watch-danger-symptoms-dengue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptoms of dengue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A lab test is the only way to confirm dengue infection. However, the type of Dengue test may depend on the time of infection and the appearance of the symptoms of dengue fever. Therefore, before you consider a blood test for dengue, you must know about the different types of blood tests available. </span></p>
<p><b>Dengue testing is divided into 2 categories:</b></p>
<p><b>A) Direct Tests: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tests identifying the virus by antigen / genetic signature.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include a nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test done through ELISA, and a dengue PCR test done using RT-PCR technique. These tests are 99-100% specific with the latter having higher sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">B) Indirect Tests:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tests related to the body&#8217;s response against the virus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include IgM and IgG antibodies against Dengue virus measured by ELISA technique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a quick read which can guide you about the different tests suggested to identify dengue infection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A) Direct Tests</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Dengue NS1 Antigen</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test is performed early in the course of infection, usually within the first 5 days of the onset of symptoms. This is because NS 1 antigen starts to appear from the very first day of dengue infection and may be present for up to 5-7 days. Thereafter, it starts disappearing from the body and may therefore indicate false-negative results. </span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">2. Dengue RT-PCR test</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test is also used to detect dengue virus in the early course (first 5 to 7 days) of the infection. It detects the viral genome (the genetic material of the virus) in the blood. This test is around 90% sensitive and 95% specific against the infection. This is the most sensitive and specific test suggested to be taken in the initial phase of the infection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.1mglabs.com/test/dengue-rna-pcr-qual-2432"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dengue PCR test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be done within 5 days after the symptoms start to appear.</span></p>
<p><b>B) Indirect Tests </b></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">1. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) test for Dengue</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This test detects IgM (antibodies) in the blood, which appear in the initial phase of the disease, and signifies acute infection or recent infection. It is advised to undergo a </span><a href="https://www.1mglabs.com/test/dengue-antibody-igm-2100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dengue antibody IgM tes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">t if you experience the symptoms of dengue continue for more than 5 days. It is usually done after the 4th day of the occurrence of the symptoms as the antibodies start developing after 4-5 days of infection. </span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b></p>
<p><i>-In the <strong>1st week of the onset of symptoms,</strong> dengue PCR test and NS1 antigen are recommended.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8211;<strong>Between the 3rd to 9th day</strong>, a combination of NS1 antigen/ PCR and IgM antibodies is recommended.</i></p>
<p><b>2. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) test for Dengue</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The test is used to detect infection in the later course of the disease because the level of IgG which is to be monitored in the test tends to increase slowly. Usually, IgG antibodies are detectable in low quantities starting around 14-21 days of the infection, after which they slowly increase. These antibodies can remain in the blood for around 90 days and in some cases may remain for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get an </span><a href="https://www.1mglabs.com/test/dengue-antibody-igg-2117"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IgG antibody test for dengue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after 14-21 days of infection or even later as these antibodies remain in the blood several months post infection. The presence of IgG antibodi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">es signifies previous infection, recovery after dengue or post vaccination against dengue.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Complete Blood Count</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dengue is frequently associated with decreased platelet count (normal platelet count lies in the range of 1.5 to 4 lacs). Therefore, platelet count should be monitored carefully and regularly, especially when the fever comes down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a patient is positive for dengue-specific antigen, a decrease in platelet count and a decrease in total white blood cells (WBC) count may be seen. But, it is important to know that </span><b>diagnosis of dengue does not depend solely on platelet counts.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above-mentioned lab tests can help diagnose and confirm a dengue fever. But it is possible that some of these tests may miss a diagnosis in a few people if the tests are not performed during a specified time of illness. While Dengue RT-PCR remains the most sensitive and specific test for dengue, a combined NS1 antigen &amp; IgM are also useful in detecting early infection.</span></p>
<p><b>How To Treat Dengue?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no particular treatment available to completely eradicate dengue infection from the body. In order to better manage dengue, the focus is kept on improving the symptoms and ensuring sufficient rest. Fever can be treated with antipyretic drugs like paracetamol to bring down the temperature and also relieve body aches. Medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen, etc. should be avoided as they may increase the risk of hemorrhage. </span><b>Antibiotics or Antivirals are not required </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as these generally have no positive effect in managing dengue fever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some suggested ways to manage dengue fever:</span></p>
<p><b>Drink plenty of fluids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay hydrated. This is advised to relieve the symptoms until the infection has gone. </span><b>Eat a healthy diet </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition to taking sufficient rest. </span></p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t forget to take doctor&#8217;s advice </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you notice that the condition is getting worse or if symptoms like uncontrolled fever, loose motions, cold clammy skin, decreased blood pressure, decreased appetite, feeble pulse, pain in the abdomen, or dark stools (charcoal or tar colored feces) appear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most patients with dengue fever generally experience mild illness and may not require hospitalization. They can be treated at home by following strict dietary guidelines and guided course of medication. Keep track of the symptoms as in some cases aggravation of symptoms may also be observed pertaining to potentially serious complications. These aggravated or continued symptoms may indicate severe dengue or dengue hemorrhagic fever, which may require hospitalization.</span></p>
<p><b>How To Stay Protected Against Dengue?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As dengue is caused by a mosquito bite, the best way to prevent dengue is to stay protected against mosquitoes. Here are some simple and effective ways to prevent mosquito bite and its disease following partner dengue:</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&#8211; Use mosquito repellents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some people may be more prone to mosquito bites than others. Applying a thin, even layer of mosquito repellent on exposed areas of the skin will keep the mosquitoes away.</span><a style="font-size: 14px;" href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/personal-care/skin-care/mosquito-repellents-115"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore our range of mosquito repellents to protect yourself.</span></a></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&#8211; Use an insecticide-treated mosquito net or spray insecticides: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing an insecticide-treated net on your bed while sleeping can save you from mosquito bites. Do make sure that there are no holes in the net. Also, treat your house with insecticides once or twice a year to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&#8211; Protect windows with nets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cover your doors and windows with mosquito mesh to stop mosquitoes from entering the house. Keep your doors and windows closed during dusk and dawn, the time when mosquitoes are most active.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&#8211; Cover yourself with clothing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To avoid mosquito bites, you can wear full-length, loose-fitting pants and full-sleeved shirts. Avoid wearing short clothes and half-sleeved shirts.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&#8211; Look out for water pits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aedes mosquitoes harbors in fresh stagnant water; therefore, it is necessary to remove water that gets collected in spots such as AC trays, room coolers, potted plants, flower vases, water containers or tanks, and clogged drains. Clean dark corners/rooms, behind the curtains, and dust bins, as all these factors can act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, the best way to manage the spread of dengue infection is prevention. Prevention is always better than cure. Let’s do our bit to prevent it!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39712" title="5 Supplements To Keep YOU Healthy &amp; Fit!" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/supplements-health.jpg" alt="supplements health" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blame it on the current lifestyle or our unhealthy eating habits, most of us have stopped taking care of our health for good. While active lifestyle, sound sleep, and stress-free are important to stay healthy, so is the need to ensure proper nutritional intake through diet, and if your diet fails to meet your nutritional needs, then taking the help of the supplements to ensure the proper functioning of the body is not a bad idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering how to get started? Well, here is a list of 5 common </span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/search/all?name=zimunat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supplements that can help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you to keep up with your diet as well as overall health. Remember supplements are just an alternative and not a replacement for a healthy, balanced diet. So do consult your doctor before you plan to take any supplements. </span></p>
<p><b>1. Lactic acid bacillus for a healthy gut</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have heard the saying “Healthy digestion is healthy you”, you might be well aware of the role of a healthy gut in keeping you healthy and fit. And lactic acid bacillus, also known as the good bacteria, is one of the key factors that not only improve digestion but also keep your gut healthy. These bacteria act as probiotics which help in restoring the balance of good bacteria in the intestine and also inhibit or decrease the growth of harmful microorganisms in the gut. They also protect the intestinal lining from inflammation and help in the production of the gastric juices needed for digestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can try </span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/search/all?name=zimunat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZimUNat lactic acid bacillus supplements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which are available in the form of instantly dissolvable films. All you have to do is place these films on the tongue and you are ready to reap the benefits thanks to its fast delivery. For children, senior citizens, bedridden patients, and mentally challenged individuals, who may not like to take tablets and syrups, these supplements can do the trick as they are simple-to-take and taste good.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Melatonin to fix your sleep woes!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the hectic schedule coupled with perpetual screen time till late nights, our sleep cycle has gone for a toss! And prolonged hours of less sleep coupled with stress further leads to problems with concentration, indigestion, etc. But adding melatonin to your diet can help you to cut down on these woes and help you sleep like a baby. This is because melatonin is a hormone that is responsible for the sleep-wake cycle.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><b>3. Vitamin D3 to fix your bones</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps the gut to absorb calcium from food and the body to maintain adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus &#8212; two minerals essential for bone health. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps in cell growth, immune function, inflammation, and neuromuscular functions. Lack of Vitamin D can make you prone to numerous health complications such as osteoporosis, infections, allergies, cardiovascular diseases, depression, and even cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommends a daily supplement of 400 IU/day of Vitamin D3 for Indians with an emphasis on outdoor activities to achieve adequate amounts of Vitamin D. So if you are not meeting your daily requirement of Vitamin D3 or are suffering from Vitamin D3 deficiency, supplements that contain Vitamin D3 should be taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to take Vitamin D supplements, you can </span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/search/all?name=zimunat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">give ZimUNat supplements a try</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are non-sticky and instantly dissolving films that when placed on the tongue dissolve quickly. This means you do not require water to take these supplements. Moreover, it is easy to carry and easy to store and can be anytime and anywhere as per your convenience.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) powers the mind and body</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methylcobalamin is a form of Vitamin B12 which plays a key role in brain function and is also needed for the production of red blood cells and in iron absorption. The deficiency of this mineral can lead to nerve dysfunction and anemia caused due to Vitamin B12 deficiency. It also boosts metabolism and increases your energy level by converting foods into energy. So supplementing your diet with this nutrient can help correct the nutritional deficiency of Vitamin B12 and improve the symptoms of anemia.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Vitamin B7 (Biotin) ‘care’s for your skin and hair</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also known as Vitamin H, it is one of the few B-complex vitamins that are needed for hair growth, strong nails, and glowing skin. Additionally, the vitamin is needed for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It breaks down food into sugar, lipids, and amino acids.  It is also needed for the repair and restoration of dead skin cells and aid in the production of keratin, needed for hair and nail growth. The deficiency of biotin can lead to thinning or splitting of hair and brittle hair, and brittle nails.</span></p>
<p><b><i>About ZimUNat:</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a </span></i><a href="https://www.1mg.com/search/all?name=zimunat"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nutraceutical supplement brand</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that uses Thinoral(R) Technology to produce instantly dissolving films that are placed on the tongue to deliver action. These are rapidly dissolving, non-sticky, non-tacky, and non-curving in nature.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39696" title="5 Simple Ways To Keep Your Joints Healthy" src="https://www.1mg.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Joint-pain.jpg" alt="Joint pain" width="630" height="380" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of their unique shapes and sizes, all joints are immensely important for our overall well-being. They are the meeting points of bones, protected by strong cartilages which enable us to move around and carry our daily activities. Despite being critically important, we often skip caring for the wellness of our joints. Owing to our unhealthy lifestyle and lack of proper exercise, we subject our joints to damage that can sometimes be irreversible.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s never too late to take care of your joint health. All you have to do is make a few simple changes in your lifestyle to</span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/health-conditions/bone-joint-muscle-care-34?filter=true&amp;brand=Go%20365"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improve your bone and joint health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wondering how? Well here is how you can get started!</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">1. Your Diet Is The Key</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time and again, experts have always emphasized the power of a healthy and balanced diet to stay healthy and wise. And the same rule applies to keep our joints healthy and protect them in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including veggies like Spinach, Amaranth, Fenugreek in your diet will improve the condition of your joints as these are excellent sources of nutrients like iron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C, K, and A, which are great for joints. Also eat fruits like orange, strawberries, or lemon daily as they have a high content of Vitamin C, an antioxidant that fights cartilage damaging free radicals. Using anti-inflammatory herbs like turmeric and garlic in a daily diet reduces pain and inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, avoid fizzy drinks as well as stale and cold food. Say no to foods containing excessive sugar, salt, caffeine, and preservatives as these can adversely affect joint health and worsen inflammation.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">2. Keep A Close Tab On Your Weight</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being overweight or obese can not only put pressure on the joints but is also known to cause inflammation. The pressure gets compounded depending upon the nature of the activity. More the pressure; more is the wear and tear that the joints are subjected to. Moreover, obesity is known to be a key risk factor for osteoarthritis of load-bearing joints such as the knee, hip, and ankle[1].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing excess weight will help in ensuring the health and</span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/health-conditions/bone-joint-muscle-care-34?filter=true&amp;brand=Go%20365"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimal functioning of all your joints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Take up an exercise routine, go for brisk walks or join a gym for shedding those extra kilos and remember to do it religiously.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">3. Gain Some Muscle</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to perform daily activities such as lifting weights or maintaining a healthy weight, our muscles &amp; joints play a crucial role. However, to reduce the pressure being exerted on your joints, you need to have proper muscle strength as they support the joints and aid in performing any activity. Also, stronger muscles mean less wear and tear of bones, ligaments, and tendons and are also less prone to injury. So start muscle strengthening exercises that aim to improve muscles around your joints and give added support to your joints.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">3. Maintain The Right Posture</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that most of us spend our time sitting in front of our computer or on a sofa with a phone in hand. This can not only put pressure on the spine but also increase the risk of back pain and other joint and bone problems[2].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent this, make sure to consciously maintain a correct upright posture when sitting as well as walking. After you wake up in the morning or every hour or two hours of sitting, make sure to stretch your body for 10-15 minutes as it improves joint mobility.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">4. Take Help Of Supplements (If Needed)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to unhealthy eating habits, most of us fail to meet the recommended daily allowance of essential vitamins and minerals. This is why it is a good idea to</span><a href="https://www.1mg.com/categories/health-conditions/bone-joint-muscle-care-34?filter=true&amp;brand=Go%20365"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplement your diet with supplements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as calcium and Vitamin D to help maintain bone and joint health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also as we age, the joints show signs of wear and tear leading to joint pain, inflammation and stiffness. These also could be early signs of osteoarthritis. Thankfully herbs like turmeric and Boswellia[4], which have powerful anti-inflammatory properties help provide relief from pain and stiffness. Nutraceuticals like Glucosamine and Chondroitin[5] slow down cartilage degradation and improve joint health. These herbs coupled with essential minerals can optimize joint health and prevent joint degeneration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, do consult your doctor before taking any supplements to know the right dose and right type of supplements based on your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a healthy body, most people take healthy joints for granted. However, with age and a sedentary lifestyle, joint and bone problems are quite common. But simply following a few basic tips and tricks can go a long way to keep your joints healthy and prevent joint problems. Stay healthy and stay strong!</span></p>
